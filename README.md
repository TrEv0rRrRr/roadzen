# RoadZen Platform

RoadZen Platform is a small Spring Boot service that provides an API to manage automatic vehicles.

It implements the required business rules using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), CQRS, and a layered architecture with multiple Bounded Contexts and a shared kernel.

Inter-context communication is handled through Anti-Corruption Layers (ACL) and event-driven mechanisms where applicable.
